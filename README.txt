IDE: Apache NetBeans 11.0
Java Version: 11.0.8

Background:

This simple application provides a part and product inventory tracking system.  Parts can be added, updated, and deleted.  Products have the same functionality, but include the capability to associate parts with the product.

Instructions:
After importing the project into NetBeans, run the program.  The main screen will appear.  Parts are displayed in the left table and products are displayed in the right table. A search capability is included for each table.  Press the appropriate buttons to perform the desired function.

Future functionality for this program would include implementation of JDBC to store the part and product information in a database.  All information is currently lost when the program is closed.
